        <div class="col-md-6 bg-light text-black" >Welcome to my lab Honorable Judge Jackson. Before we get started, if you are not familiar with Dr. Joy Degruy, I invite you to press play, and listen as she defines “post-traumatic slave syndrome” and how it affects Black people today.  On my healing journey I struggled to understand why those that were suppossed to love me, did not do so in the way our creator instructs. For all of my adult life that served as a source of anger until I ran across this woman and her studies. I had heard of the concept of trauma being passed down from generation to generation, but failed to understand, even growing up in the midst of the crack epidemic, that raveged our neighborhoods from one coast to the next. I'm not here to seek your pity, as I have taken responsibility for the actions in my life, made the proper adjustments and set my sails for fair winds and following seas, as any good sailor would do. While my naval career was cut short, and a subsequent federal prison sentence of 36 months to serve in F.C.I. Petersburg, located in Petersburg Va.
